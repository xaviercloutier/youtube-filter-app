# YouTube Filter App Research Notes

## YouTube Data API Overview

The YouTube Data API v3 allows developers to build applications that can search for and retrieve YouTube videos with various filtering capabilities. This document summarizes the key findings from researching the API's capabilities, authentication requirements, and limitations.

## Authentication Requirements

To use the YouTube Data API, you need to:

1. Create a Google Account to access the Google API Console
2. Create a project in the Google Developers Console
3. Obtain authorization credentials (API key or OAuth 2.0)
4. Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project
5. Implement authentication in your application

Authentication options:
- **API Key**: For public data access only (no user-specific data)
- **OAuth 2.0**: For accessing user-specific data or performing actions on behalf of users

## API Capabilities and Endpoints

The YouTube Data API provides several resource types and operations:

### Main Resources:
- `search`: Search for videos, channels, and playlists
- `videos`: Get detailed information about specific videos
- `channels`: Get information about YouTube channels
- `playlists`: Get information about playlists
- `playlistItems`: Get videos within playlists

### Key Operations:
- `list`: Retrieve resources (GET)
- `insert`: Create new resources (POST)
- `update`: Modify existing resources (PUT)
- `delete`: Remove resources (DELETE)

## Filtering Parameters

The `search.list` endpoint supports extensive filtering capabilities:

### Required Parameters:
- `part`: Specifies the resource properties to include in the response (e.g., "snippet")

### Optional Filtering Parameters:

#### General Filters:
- `q`: Search query term
- `type`: Resource type to search for (comma-separated list: "video", "channel", "playlist")
- `maxResults`: Maximum number of items to return (default: 5, max: 50)
- `pageToken`: Token for pagination (nextPageToken/prevPageToken)
- `order`: Sorting order ("date", "rating", "relevance", "title", "videoCount", "viewCount")
- `regionCode`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code to restrict results by region
- `relevanceLanguage`: ISO 639-1 two-letter language code for search relevance
- `safeSearch`: Content filtering level ("none", "moderate", "strict")
- `topicId`: Restricts results to a specific topic

#### Channel Filters:
- `channelId`: Restricts results to a specific channel
- `channelType`: Type of channels to search ("any", "show")

#### Video-specific Filters:
- `videoCaption`: Filter by caption availability ("any", "closedCaption", "none")
- `videoCategoryId`: Filter by video category
- `videoDefinition`: Filter by video definition ("any", "high", "standard")
- `videoDimension`: Filter by video dimension ("any", "2d", "3d")
- `videoDuration`: Filter by video length ("any", "long", "medium", "short")
- `videoEmbeddable`: Filter by embeddable videos ("any", "true")
- `videoLicense`: Filter by video license ("any", "creativeCommon", "youtube")
- `videoSyndicated`: Filter by syndicated videos ("any", "true")
- `videoType`: Filter by video type ("any", "episode", "movie")

#### Live Streaming Filters:
- `eventType`: Filter by event type ("completed", "live", "upcoming")

#### User-specific Filters (require authorization):
- `forContentOwner`: Restrict to content owner's videos
- `forDeveloper`: Restrict to developer's videos
- `forMine`: Restrict to authenticated user's videos

## Response Structure

A successful API response includes:
- `kind`: Resource type
- `etag`: Entity tag for caching
- `nextPageToken`/`prevPageToken`: Pagination tokens
- `pageInfo`: Information about the result set
- `items`: Array of resources matching the query

## Quota Limitations

The YouTube Data API uses a quota system to ensure fair usage:

- Each project has a default quota of 10,000 units per day
- Different operations cost different amounts of quota:
  - `search.list`: 100 units per call
  - `videos.list`: 1 unit per call
  - `channels.list`: 1 unit per call
  - `playlists.list`: 1 unit per call
  - `videos.insert`: 1600 units per call

Important considerations:
- Each request, including invalid ones, costs at least 1 unit
- Pagination requests each incur the full cost of the original request
- Quota is shared across all API methods in a project

## Best Practices

1. Use specific filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
2. Implement pagination to handle large result sets
3. Use partial responses with the `fields` parameter to reduce response size
4. Cache responses when appropriate to reduce quota usage
5. Handle quota errors gracefully in the application
6. Monitor quota usage to avoid unexpected service interruptions

## Implementation Considerations

For our YouTube Filter App, we should:
1. Use an API key for authentication (sufficient for search functionality)
2. Implement comprehensive filtering options in the UI
3. Handle pagination for browsing large result sets
4. Implement error handling for quota limits and API errors
5. Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce quota usage
6. Provide clear feedback to users about search results and any limitations
